.

This repo is for recording code changes for JavaQemu software.

Mirroring information about JavaQemu:

JavaQemu was my GUI Front End project for QEMU, written in Java.
JavaQemu works with JRE 1.7/1.8 (and more recent JREs) and MS Windows OS.

This project is inactive and was replaced by a new project in the future!

Obs.: This project will not be developed anymore, because I am planning to make a new project of a GUI Front End project for QEMU.
Thank you for your comprehension!
