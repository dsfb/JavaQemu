This repo is for recording code changes for JavaQemu software.

Mirroring information about JavaQemu:

JavaQemu was my GUI Front End project for QEMU, written in Java.
JavaQemu works with JRE 1.7/1.8 (and more recent JREs) and MS Windows OS.

This project is inactive and was replaced by my new project: KotlEmu!

Obs.: This project will not be developed anymore, because I am studying Kotlin programming language, and I am making a new project of a GUI Front End project for QEMU, called: KotlEmu. Thank you for your comprehension!

The page of my new project is: https://sourceforge.net/projects/kotlemu/
